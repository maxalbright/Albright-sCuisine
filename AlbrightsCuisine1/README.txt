To Create Database:
- open "createDatabase.sql" in mySQLWorkbench and run it
- or right click on it in eclipse, and select "Open with SQL File Editor", then copy and paste it into workbench and run it


Make sure that when you open the project you have a Tomcat v9.0 server to use and that it is bound.
To bind the server, right-click the project name, click properties, click Libraries, click Server runtime, and if Tomcat isn't bound, doubleclick it and bind it. 

There may be a weird bug in Eclipse where it says there is an error in index.jsp, but if you run it, it works anyway.


Run the code by running index.jsp in eclipse.
